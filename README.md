# NeRFToMetahumanUE5

This workflow captures a 3D render of a face using a modified NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) model, specifically trained for faces. It then generates a high-quality metahuman model in Unreal Engine 5, compatible with the Metahuman Creator toolset. The process involves 3D face rendering, NeRF model training, metahuman mesh generation, and character setup in UE5.
## Initial generation prompt
a workflow that uses NeRF to capture a 3D render of a face, and converts it into a metahuman in unreal engine 5
