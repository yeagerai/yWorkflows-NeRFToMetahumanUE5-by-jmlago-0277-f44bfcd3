# Component Name
NeRFToMeshConverter

# Description
This component is designed to convert a NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) render to a 3D mesh representation in a Yeager Workflow. The NeRFToMeshConverter accepts input data as a NeRF render and returns the converted mesh in either .fbx or .obj format based on the specified configuration.

# Input and Output Models
- `NeRFToMeshConverterInputDict`: A `BaseModel` subclass that validates and serializes the input data for the component. It consists of the `neRF_render` parameter, which is an object representing the NeRF render.
- `NeRFToMeshConverterOutputDict`: A `BaseModel` subclass that validates and serializes the output data for the component. It consists of the `mesh` parameter, having the `Path` type that represents a filepath to the stored mesh file.

# Parameters
- `output_format` (str): The format in which the mesh output should be saved, either .fbx or .obj. It has a default value specified in the component's YAML configuration file.
- `precision` (float): A floating point precision parameter used during the conversion process. It has a default value specified in the component's YAML configuration file.

# Transform Function
The `transform` function is responsible for converting the NeRF render to a mesh representation and saving it to the specified output format. It takes a `NeRFToMeshConverterInputDict` instance as input and returns a `NeRFToMeshConverterOutputDict` instance as its output. The steps it performs are as follows:

1. Retrieve the `precision` and `output_format` parameters.
2. Convert the input NeRF render to a mesh representation using the specified `precision` parameter. (Implementation details for the conversion process should be added in this section).
3. Export the resultant mesh to the specified `output_format`, either .fbx or .obj. The mesh is saved with a filename `converted_mesh.<output_format>`.
4. Return an instance of `NeRFToMeshConverterOutputDict`, which contains the filepath to the saved mesh file.

# External Dependencies
- `os`: Imported for interacting with the file system.
- `yaml`: Imported for reading the YAML-formatted component configuration file.
- `pathlib`: Imported for managing and manipulating filepaths.
- `pydantic`: Imported for creating, validating, and serializing input and output data models for the component.

# API Calls
This component does not make any external API calls.

# Error Handling
Any errors related to file handling or data processing are raised as Python exceptions. Errors are expected to be handled by users of this component based on their specific use case.

# Examples
