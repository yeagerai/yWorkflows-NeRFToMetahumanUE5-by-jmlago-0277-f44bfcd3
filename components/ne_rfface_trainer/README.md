# Component Name

NeRFFaceTrainer

# Description

The NeRFFaceTrainer component is responsible for training a NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) model on a provided image sequence, and generates depth maps using the trained model. This component is essential for working with face images and depth information in a Yeager Workflow.

# Input and Output Models

The component makes use of the following input and output models:

1. **NeRFFaceTrainerInputDict**:
    - `processed_image_sequence`: List of Image objects representing the input image sequence.
    
2. **NeRFFaceTrainerOutputDict**:
    - `trained_neRF_model`: NeRFModel object representing the trained NeRF model.
    - `generated_depth_maps`: List of DepthMap objects representing the depth maps generated from the trained NeRF model.

Both models inherit from the `BaseModel` class, which handles validation and serialization for the data.

# Parameters

The following parameters are used by the component:

- `learning_rate` (float): Learning rate for the model's training, default value is read from the component's YAML configuration file.
- `num_epochs` (int): Number of training epochs, default value is read from the component's YAML configuration file.
- `batch_size` (int): Batch size during model training, default value is read from the component's YAML configuration file.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` function is implemented with the following steps:

1. Initialize the NeRF model with the given learning rate.
2. Load the processed image sequence from the input data.
3. Split the image sequence into training and validation sets using the `split_image_sequence()` method.
4. Train the NeRF model on the training set for the specified number of epochs and batch size.
5. Validate the NeRF model on the validation set.
6. Generate depth maps using the trained NeRF model.
7. Return the trained NeRF model and generated depth maps as an instance of `NeRFFaceTrainerOutputDict` class.

# External Dependencies

The component relies on the following external libraries:

- `yaml`: For loading component parameters from a YAML configuration file.
- `dotenv`: For loading environment variables.
- `fastapi`: For creating API endpoints and handling HTTP requests.

# API Calls

There are no external API calls made by this component.

# Error Handling

The error handling in this component is primarily managed by the Pydantic validation for input and output data. Additionally, errors that may occur during training or validation are assumed to be handled by the NeRFModel class.

# Examples

Here's an example of how to use the NeRFFaceTrainer component within a Yeager Workflow:
