# Component Name

NeRFToMetahumanUE5

# Description

The `NeRFToMetahumanUE5` component is designed for processing image sequences and camera parameters to generate a Metahuman model compatible with Unreal Engine 5. This component is an implementation of the `AbstractWorkflow` class and serves as a key building block in a Yeager Workflow.

# Input and Output Models

The component utilizes two input data models and one output data model.

## Input Models

1. **ImageSequenceInputBaseModel**:
    - `images`: List of dictionaries containing various image-related properties.
    - `camera_parameters`: List of dictionaries containing camera-related properties.
  
## Output Model

1. **MetahumanUE5OutputBaseModel**:
    - `metahuman_model`: The resulting Metahuman model (string).
    - `unreal_engine_version`: The version of Unreal Engine compatible with the output model (string).

# Parameters

There are no parameters in this component apart from the given input models.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method of this component involves the following steps:

1. Call `super().transform(args=args, callbacks=callbacks)` to process the input data with the parent implementation of `transform()`.
2. Obtain the `metahuman_model` and `unreal_engine_version` from the resulting dictionary.
3. Package the `metahuman_model` and `unreal_engine_version` values into a `MetahumanUE5OutputBaseModel` object.
4. Return the populated output object.

# External Dependencies

The following external libraries are used by the component:

1. `typing`: for type annotations and type checking.
2. `dotenv`: for loading environment variables.
3. `fastapi`: for creating the FastAPI app and API endpoint.
4. `pydantic`: for defining the input and output data models and handling validation and serialization of the data.

# API Calls

No external API calls are made in this component.

# Error Handling

This component relies on the `AbstractWorkflow` and Pydantic's built-in error handling. Errors related to incorrect input data types or validation for the input models will be handled by Pydantic.

# Examples

Here is an example of how to use the `NeRFToMetahumanUE5` component within a Yeager Workflow:
