# Component Name
ImageSequencePreprocessor

# Description
This component preprocesses an image sequence within a Yeager Workflow. It performs image alignment, resizing, and color correction on a sequence of input images before updating the camera parameters associated with these images.

# Input and Output Models
## Input
- ImageSequencePreprocessorInput
  - raw_image_sequence (List[Image]): The input sequence of images.
  - raw_camera_parameters (Dict[str, Any]): The input camera parameters for the image sequence.
  - alignment_method (str, default='feature_based'): The method to be used for aligning images.
  - resize_dimension (List[int], default=[800, 600]): The dimensions to which images should be resized.
  - color_correction_method (str, default ='histogram_equalization'): The method to be used for color correction.

## Output
- ImageSequencePreprocessorOutput
  - processed_image_sequence (List[Image]): The output sequence of processed images.
  - updated_camera_parameters (Dict[str, Any]): The updated camera parameters for the processed image sequence.

# Parameters
- alignment_method (str, default='feature_based'):
  - The method to be used for aligning images. Options include 'feature_based', or any other custom alignment methods. Default is 'feature_based'.
- resize_dimension (List[int], default=[800, 600]):
  - The dimensions to which images should be resized. Default is [800, 600].
- color_correction_method (str, default ='histogram_equalization'):
  - The method to be used for color correction. Options include 'histogram_equalization', or any other custom color correction methods. Default is 'histogram_equalization'.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` method of the ImageSequencePreprocessor performs the following steps:
1. Align the raw_image_sequence using the method specified by `alignment_method`.
2. Resize the aligned image sequence to the dimensions specified by `resize_dimension`.
3. Perform color correction on the resized image sequence using the method specified by `color_correction_method`.
4. Update the camera parameters based on the alignment method and the new dimensions.
5. Return the processed image sequence and updated camera parameters as an ImageSequencePreprocessorOutput object.

# External Dependencies
The component uses the following external dependencies:
- dotenv: To load environment variables
- fastapi: To handle API requests
- pydantic: For input and output validation as well as serialization

There is also a placeholder for the Image class in the source code. This should be either implemented or imported from another module.

# API Calls
This component is designed to be used as a FastAPI application. An endpoint is defined at `/transform/` that listens for POST requests with the ImageSequencePreprocessorInput model as JSON payload.

# Error Handling
The component utilizes FastAPI's and Pydantic's built-in error handling for input validation and error messages. Future implementation of image-related functions like `align_images`, `resize_images`, `color_correct_images`, and `update_camera_parameters` should include appropriate error handling methods and exception handling as per the specific methods being used.

In order to use the ImageSequencePreprocessor component within a Yeager Workflow, you should consider the following example:
